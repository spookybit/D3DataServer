,"a In 2016, FHWA changed its methods for estimating the share of gasoline used in on-road and non-road applications, which created a time-series inconsistency between 2015 and previous years in this Inventory.  The method changes resulted in a decrease in the estimated motor gasoline consumption for the transportation sector and a subsequent increase in the commercial and industrial sectors of this Inventory for 2015.  The method updates are discussed further in the Planned Improvements section below under CO2 from Fossil Fuel Combustion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"b U.S. Territories are not apportioned by sector, and emissions are total greenhouse gas emissions from all fuel combustion sources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Notes: Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Emissions from fossil fuel combustion by electricity generation are allocated based on aggregate national electricity consumption by each end-use sector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
